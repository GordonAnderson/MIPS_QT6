Pulse Sequence Generation help

The MIPS system can generate pulse sequences using digital outputs and DC bias outputs.
A pulse sequence allows the user to change the digital output and DC bias voltages at
user programmed time points. These pulse sequences can use an internal programmable
clock or an external clock; additionally a pulse sequence can be started using a
command from the host computer or from an external source. Pulse sequences can contain
internal loops where a defined sequence can be repeated a programmed number of times.
Loops can be nested as well at a maximum depth of 5.

The pulse sequence generation capability uses the timer counter capability in the ARM
microcontroller at the heart of the MIPS system. This timer counter has the capability
to generate an output pulse when its count matches the value in a compare register. This
trigger is then used to change the digital and DC bias output levels via hardware in the
MIPS system. This provides a low jitter and deterministic pulse sequence generation
capability.

This tab provides the user an Pulse Sequence Editor to make generation and changing a
pulse squence simple.
