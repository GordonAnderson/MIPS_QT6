# MIPS_QT6

The MIPS host application is designed to communicate with a MIPS controller or
multiple MIPS controllers. It allows you to monitor and control parameters in
all the connected controllers. The MIPS host application supports two ways of
interacting with your MIPS systems:
   1)	When the MIPS application connects to your system(s), you will see a
        series of tabs that allow you to control individual modules in your
        system(s).  Much like the MIPS controller’s user interfaces, it allows
        you to control each module. This mode of operation allows you to select
        a tab that represents a module and allows you to interact with the
        module’s parameters.
   2)	The MIPS application under the Tools menu selection allows you to display
        control panels. A control panel is an organization of MIPS controls that
        make sense for your specific application. A number of control panels have
        been included as examples. The user can define unique control panels,
        including the ability to define your own graphics background. The custom
        control panel mode also supports multiple MIPS systems.

This application was developed using the Qt Creator version 13.0.2 and is written in Qt cpp 6.7.1.
